# cycle tied to features. It's probably best to just stay one version behind
# bleeding edge, but we need to be vigilant not to lag too far behind.

# Node does things a little differently, and uses the major version more like
# Ruby uses the minor. LTS releases are tied to the major, not minor.

# This Dockerfile combines the official Ruby Docker image with the official
# Node Docker image. Since Docker doesn't support anything like an "INCLUDE"
# directive, we start with an Alpine-based Ruby image and then tack on the
# source of an Alpine-based Node Docker image directly from GitHub. When
# upstream updates, it's necessary to refresh and rebuild this image.
#
# For a detialed discussion regarding an INCLUDE directive in Dockerfiles,
# see this issue: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/735.
